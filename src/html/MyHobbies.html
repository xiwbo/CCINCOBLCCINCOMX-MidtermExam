									<h3>The Rookie Savant</h3>
									<p><i>12 Aug 2000</i></p>
									<p>
										I'll never forget that day, back in 2018, when I first experienced the intense -- and probably addictive -- state of mind that would become a powerful force in my life. I'm remembering the first day I drove a car and the new level of consciousness I experienced as I sped down the <abbr title="A piece of road with severe bends like an S">chicane</abbr> at the Batangas Racing Circuit on Lipa City, Batangas. It came after a long straightaway, the car already at full speed as I began accelerating down the chicane. To be competitive, I had to keep my right foot hard on the accelerator and banish all thoughts from my mind, except how I was going to steer the car through the deceptively tricky right turn at the bottom without skidding off the road and crashing.
									</p>
									<p>
										During a race, the mental background noise of ordinary life, the static that chatters along in the everyday consciousness, is muted, and the racer fuses with the car and the craft of driving, absorbed completely in the slow-motion passage of the seconds. Racing can offer a taste of the intense states experienced by meditators and mystics. The experience, some drivers say, can be highly addictive. Scott himself put it this way: 'Racing cars gets to be about like being a drug addict or an alcoholic. The more you do it, the more you like to do it.'
									</p>
									<p>
										As for myself, I lost the desire to drive recklessly on the public roads after I discovered the much more intense mental pleasure that racing can bring — and with much less risk. I got my racing high while wearing a safety seatbels, fire-resistant suit and a helmet. The car had a crash-protection cage. There were stewards at every turn. And nobody on the track were drunk or texting.
